A decision is expected in early October and contract negotiations will be subsequently delayed. The impact to pilots is unclear at this time and pilots may need to extend beyond the current program timeline. In the meantime, the Program Co-directors have started work on refreshing the EIAM roadmap and developing an investment proposal for FY19 and beyond.</p>
<p>The rest of the active projects continue to make good progress. The Social Login project successfully deployed identity proofing and account linking functionality for the Alumni Association pilot. The Uniqname project team is working on technical design for the various options and is getting ready to seek input on impact to the academic campuses and Michigan Medicine. The Identity Assurance project continues campus and Michigan Medicine interviews, and the Security Zones project team is working on a project charge. </p>
<p>Key activities for next month are releasing Wave 2 Account Lifecycle Optimization improvements, socializing a RAMP recommendation with ITS and HITS leadership, and piloting Social Login with the HathiTrust Digital Library.</p>
